The metadata of an image should be stored as follows:

{
    "image_id": 12345,
    "captions": [
        "A group of people riding bicycles."
    ],
    "entities": {
        "person": [
            [[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...], [...]],  # First instance of 'person'
            [[x3, y3, x4, y4, ...], [...]]   # Second instance of 'person'
        ],
        "bicycle": [
            [[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]]  # Segmentation mask for 'bicycle'
        ]
    }
}

The name of the file should be:

{name of the dataset}_{name of the set}_{image id on the dataset}

If you consider to recolor your dataset please make sure to write the pre-processing code necessary to transform your dataset as presented.
Remember to store the images into synthetic_dataset_from_object_recoloring/src/images and the metadata into synthetic_dataset_from_object_recoloring/src/images_data in the right format.
